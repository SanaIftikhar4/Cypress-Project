This Cypress automation project is part of my TestPro Bootcamp, focused on testing the Koel music streaming application.
The repository showcases my learning journey toward writing efficient and maintainable automation tests.
Iâ€™ve created multiple versions of login tests using different page object and form handling approaches to explore better ways of simplifying and improving test logic.
Each file reflects how earlier tests were modified and enhanced to improve readability, reusability, and structure.
