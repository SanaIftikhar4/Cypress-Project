✅ How to View the Video of a Failed Test
1. Run tests with video recording:

npx cypress run
2. Go to the video folder:
After the test run, Cypress saves the video in:


cypress/videos/
Each .mp4 file corresponds to a test spec file.

📁 Example Structure:

cypress/
├── videos/
│   └── login.cy.js.mp4   ✅ ← Watch this video to see the failure
You can open the .mp4 video file using any video player (like VLC, or even your browser).

🛠️ Optional Settings in cypress.config.js:
Make sure video recording is enabled:


video: true,
To disable video for passed tests only:

j
video: true,
trashAssetsBeforeRuns: true,
videosFolder: 'cypress/videos',
screenshotOnRunFailure: true,
